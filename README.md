#ny

Ny is an opinionated ec2 management cli.

## Installation
```
pip install ny
```

## How to Use
```
# Spin up a frontend instance in production
ny servers create -t frontend production

# List Instances in the Production environment
ny servers list production

# Terminate an instance
ny servers terminate -i i-xxxxxxxx
```

## Configuration
Ny is controlled via per-project `Nyfile`'s, which allow for simple configuration via TOML. Ny allows you to define
multiple deploy environments and instance templates.

Deployment environments allow you to separate your Staging and Production environemnts, and easily deploy and manage
VMs in both. Different environments are expected to each be a unique VPC.

Instance templates allow the configuration of parameters such as `image_id`, `security_groups`, and `bootscripts`.

Here is an example configuration file:

```toml
[global]
  # Path relative to Nyfile to bootscripts folder
  bootscripts = "bootscripts"

[envs]
  [envs.production]
    vpc = "vpc-xxxxxxxx"
    key = "keypair-name"

    gateway = "SOME_IP_ADDRESS"

    subnets = [
      "subnet-xxxxxxxx",
      "subnet-yyyyyyyy",
    ]

    security_groups = [
      "Security Group Name => sg-xxxxyyyy",
      "Frontend Security Group => sg-xyxyxyxy",
    ]

    [envs.production.salt]
      # Saltstack master server
      master = "10.x.x.x"

[types]
  [types.frontend]
    image_id = "ami-1234xxxx"
    type = "t1.micro"
    security_groups = [
      "Security Group Name",
      "Frontend Security Group",
    ]

    # Relative to the global bootscript variable if set
    # Available vars: env
    bootscripts = [
      "common/common_script",
      "common/install-salt-minion",
    ]
```
